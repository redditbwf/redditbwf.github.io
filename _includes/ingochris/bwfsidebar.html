<!--
The Markdown is not processed because first the Liquid (include tag) gets processed, inserting mycontent.md into the HTML file. 
Then the Markdown would get processed.
But because the content is included into an HTML page, the Markdown isnâ€™t rendered. 
The Markdown filter processes content only in Markdown files.
