# Welcome to the new Reddit Bodyweight Fitness Wiki!
Just a Proof of Concept - Chris

it's a **modular and full featured wiki** powered by git, github pages and pull-requests without the needs of local installations/build! 

It means: 

* Improvements in the **cooperative** aspect: forks, pull-requests and roles.
* You can **customize your wiki** as you want with style sheets and even changing the layout. (see customization section below) 
* **No databases!** Only static files that can be downloaded in a few seconds.
* **Blazing fast** and free thankfully to Github Pages and Jekyll Server Side Generation process!
* **Markdown and html** mixed together!
* **Multiple free search engines!** on a static site!
* **History, revision comparison** and everything you need from a wiki platform.
* You can **edit your pages** with the standard git editor, prose.io (integrated) or any kind of editor you prefer.
* Non-existent wiki page links are "[red](wiki/red.md)", you can **click on them to automatically create a new page**!
* [External links](http://www.google.it) get the right icon automatically
* **Component system with hooks** that allows you to totally customize your wiki UI. (see customization section below) 
* Some **nice internal themes** to change your entire wiki UI with 1 simple configuration (see customization section below)
* Integrated **Blogging** feature thanks to jekyll!
